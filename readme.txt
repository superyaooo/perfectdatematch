	\ The Perfect Date Match \

This is a small app I wrote a while back when I 
studied "Learn Python The Hardway". 

This app compares two clients' information and decides if 
they should go on a date.

First, it matches the clients' gender and their sexualality.
For example, if client A is a male looking 
for another male, but client B is a male looking for a 
female, then no match. On the other hand, if client B is a 
male looking for another male, then their gender info matches.

If gender info matches, the program continues to compare 
general interests in life. If both clients have something in 
common, then a date is suggested.
